SMOKE stands for "Scripting Meta Object Kompiler Engine" - for instance ;)

This directory compiles a smokeqt (and later a smokekde) library, which
contain interfaces to (almost) all Qt and KDE classes.
The next PerlQt/PerlKDE will be based on SMOKE.
However SMOKE is language-independent enough for other bindings (e.g. to
other scripting languages) to be based on it.

Note that the .cpp source files are auto-generated by kalyptus, from reading
the Qt/KDE headers.
